## 🔔 News

- **[2025-10-21]** 📢 Our work is reported by [Synced (机器之心)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/laPqnICWG-PIVIDQOTnbNQ)!
- **[2025-10-10]** ✨ Code is now available.
- **[2025-09-30]** 📄 Our paper is released on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26628).



## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyanLiu112/AttnRL.git
cd AttnRL
```

Create a new conda environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n attnrl python=3.10
conda activate attnrl
bash scripts/install_vllm_sglang_mcore.sh
```

### Data Preparation

The training dataset ([DeepScaleR-Preview-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agentica-org/DeepScaleR-Preview-Dataset)) is at `data/train/deepscaler_train.parquet`, which contains `40.3k` mathematical reasoning data.
The evaluation datasets are in `data/eval/` and the suffix `_${K}` indicates the number of duplicate samples for each question.

### Training

For training AttnRL with [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) backbone on 8 H100 GPUs, run:

```bash
bash recipe/attnrl/run_attnrl_r1_distill_1.5b_8k.sh
```

### Evaluation

Evaluation scripts are the same as the training scripts. `+trainer.val_only=True` should be added to perform evaluation only. We recommend setting `data.max_prompt_length=2048` and `data.max_response_length=32768`.
