Specifically, we need to check if the points are arranged such that one pair of points from each segment is separated by the other pair. For example, if we label the points in clockwise order as \\(A, C, B, D\\) or \\(A, D, B, C\\), then the segments \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) will intersect.

The area of a square is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\text{side}^2 = 2^2 = 4 \\]\n\nThus, the area of the quadrilateral is:\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]", -1.0, "system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

Without loss of generality, we can fix point \\(A\\) at a specific position (say, 12 o'clock) and consider the relative positions of the other points.\n\n2. **Determine the Condition for Intersection**: The segments \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged such that one of the points \\(C\\) or \\(D\\) lies between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (in the clockwise direction) and the other point lies between \\(B\\) and \\(A\\) (in the clockwise direction).
