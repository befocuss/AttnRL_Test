Without loss of generality, we can fix point \\(A\\) at a specific position (say, 12 o'clock) and consider the relative positions of the other points.\n\n2. **Determine the Order of Points**: The key to determining whether \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) intersect is to consider the relative order of the points. Specifically, we need to check if the points are arranged such that one pair of points from each segment is separated by the other pair. For example, if we label the points in clockwise order as \\(A, C, B, D\\) or \\(A, D, B, C\\), then the segments \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) will intersect.

Therefore, out of the 24 possible arrangements, 12 will result in intersecting segments.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that segments \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
